### Introduction

Artisan provides install packages for all supported platforms on [GitHub](https://github.com/artisan-roaster-scope/artisan/releases).  However, some users may desire to run Artisan directly from the source code.  This document explains how to do so on macOS, Linux and Windows. 

While this document is presumed free of errors as of January 2024, there is no guarantee that it is correct as you read it.  If you find an error or discrepancy please start a [new general discussion](https://github.com/artisan-roaster-scope/artisan/discussions/new?category=general) on GitHub.


### Installation on macOS/Linux/Windows

1. Install git from [scm-git.com](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

2. Install Python 3.11 from [python.org](https://www.python.org/)

   >*Note for Windows: Python may be installed from the Microsoft Store or by direct download from the link above.  When installed from the Microsoft Store it is normally started using `python3` as shown below.  When Python is installed by direct download it is normally started with the command `python`. Also note, the Windows command prompt is '>' where the macOS/Linux prompt is '#' as shown below.*


3. Create and activate a virtual environment

    macOS and Linux
    ```
    # python3 -m venv artisan_venv
    # source artisan_venv/bin/activate
    ```

    Windows
    ```
    > python3 -m venv artisan_venv
    > artisan_venv\scripts\activate
    ```

4. Clone the Artisan repository

    ```
    # git clone https://github.com/artisan-roaster-scope/artisan.git
    ```

5. Install required packages

    ```
    # cd artisan/src
    # pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

6. Start Artisan from the artisan/src directory. 

   ```
   # python3 artisan.py
   ```

### Application log

- macOS

   ```
   # tail -f ~/Library/Application\ Support/artisan-scope/Artisan/artisan.log
   ```

- Linux

   ```
   # tail -f ~/.local/shared/artisan-scope/Artisan/artisan.log
   ```
 - Windows

   ```
   > notepad %localappdata%\artisan-scope\Artisan\artisan.log
   ```


### UI files

Some UI components are described using `.ui` files, which are compiled to
corresponding `.py` files, before they can be used. The generated files
are part of the source code, so if you change any `.ui` file, make sure
to run `build_ui.py`.

This script tries to generate code for both PyQt5 and PyQt6, but during
during development it is ok to have only one of these installed. Only
make sure to install both and re-run the script, before you open a PR
or commit to the main repository.


### Installing and running dev tools

```
# pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

Linting


```
# codespell
# ruff check .
# pylint */*.py
```

Typing

```
# mypy
# pyright
# mypy --strict
```

Testing


```

```

Coverage (types, tests)

```
# mypy --xslt-html-report coverage
# pytest --cov --cov-report=html
# pytest --hypothesis-show-statistics
# coverage run -m pytest
# coverage-badge -o coverage.svg
```
